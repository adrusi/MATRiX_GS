Browser Support
===============
The background grid works only in Mozilla and Webkit-based browsers (it uses CSS3 gradients since the width of columns and margins can vary). Everything else has been tested in Internet Explorer 6, Opera 10, Webkit and Mozilla (FF2+) and has worked in every tested browser.
